CONSULTANT may maintain the required post agreement coverage by renewal \nor purchase of prior acts or tail coverage. This provision is contingent upon post agreement coverage \nbeing both available and reasonably affordable in relation to the coverage provided during the term of \nthis Agreement. For purposes of interpreting this requirement, a cost not exceeding 100% of the last \nannual policy premium during the term of this Agreement in order to purchase prior acts or tail \ncoverage for post agreement coverage shall be deemed to be reasonable. The COMMISSION will not \nbe responsible for any premiums or assessments on the policy. \n \n2) All required Automobile and Comprehensive or Commercial General Liability Insurance shall be \nendorsed to contain the following clause: \n \n“Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, its officials, employees, agents and \nvolunteers are added as an additional insured as respects the operations and activities of, or on behalf \nof, the named insured performed under Agreement with the Commission.” \n \n3) All required insurance policies shall be endorsed to contain the following clause: \n“This insurance shall not be canceled until after thirty (30) days prior written notice has been given \nto: \n \n \nSanta Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission \n \n \n \nAttn: Yesenia Parra \n \n \n \n1523 Pacific Avenue \nSanta Cruz, CA 95060 \n \n4) CONSULTANT agrees to provide its insurance broker(s) with a full copy of these insurance \nprovisions and provide COMMISSION on or before the effective date of this Agreement with \nCertificates of Insurance for all required coverages. All Certificates of Insurance shall be delivered or \nsent to: \n \n \n \nSanta Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission \n \n \n \nAttn: Yesenia Parra \n \n \n \n1523 Pacific Avenue \n \n \n \nSanta Cruz, CA 95060 \n \n \n \n5) The CONSULTANT agrees that the insurance herein provided for, shall be in effect at all times \nduring the term of this contract. In the event said insurance coverage expires at any time or times \nduring the term of this contract, the CONSULTANT agrees to provide at least thirty (30) days prior \nnotice to said expiration date; and a new Certificate of Insurance evidencing insurance coverage as \nprovided for herein, for not less than either the remainder of the term of the contract, or for a period \nof not less than one (1) year. New Certificates of Insurance are subject to the approval of the \nCOMMISSION. In the event the CONSULTANT fails to keep in effect at all times insurance\n\nPage 5 \ncoverage as herein provided, the COMMISSION may, in addition to any other remedies it may have, \nterminate this Agreement upon occurrence of such event. \n \n6) If any insurance policy of CONSULTANT required by this document includes language \nconditioning the insurer’s legal obligation to defend or indemnify COMMISSION on the \nperformance of any act(s) by the named insured, then said insurance policy, by endorsement, \nshall also name the COMMISSION as a named insured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both \nthe CONSULTANT and its insurers agree that by naming the COMMISSION as a named \ninsured, the COMMISSION may at its sole direction, but is not obligated to, perform any act \nrequired by the named insured under said insurance policies. \n \n7) CONSULTANT shall do all things required to be performed by it pursuant to its insurance policies \nincluding but not limited to paying within five (5) work days, all deductibles and self-insured \nretentions (SIR) required to be paid under any insurance policy that may provide defense or \nindemnity coverage to COMMISSION or any additional insured. \n \n8) CONSULTANT shall cause the foregoing provisions to be inserted in all subcontracts for any work \ncovered under this Agreement by a subconsultant compensated more than $50,000 and employing \nmore than fifteen (15) employees, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to contracts \nor subcontracts for standard commercial supplies or raw materials. \n \n7. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. CONSULTANT warrants that in the performance of this \nAgreement, it shall exercise usual and customary professional care in its efforts to comply with all applicable \nfederal, state and local laws, statutes and ordinances and all lawful orders, rules and regulations promulgated \nthereunder. In the event of a conflict between the laws and lawful regulations of any government entities \nhaving jurisdiction over the project, the CONSULTANT shall notify COMMISSION of the nature and \nimpact of such conflict. The COMMISSION agrees to cooperate and work with the CONSULTANT in an \neffort to resolve any conflict. \n \n8. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. During and in relation to the performance of this Agreement, \nCONSULTANT agrees to the following: \n \nThe CONSULTANT shall not discriminate or permit discrimination against any employee or applicant for \nemployment in any manner prohibited by Federal, State and local laws, including but not limited to race, \ncolor, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital \nstatus, sexual orientation, age (over 18), veteran status, pregnancy, or any other non-merit factor unrelated to \njob duties. \n \nSuch action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: recruitment; advertising, layoff or termination; \nrates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training (including apprenticeship), \nemployment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer. The CONSULTANT agrees to post in conspicuous places, \navailable to employees and applicants for employment, notice setting forth the provisions of this non-\ndiscrimination clause. \n \nCONSULTANT shall comply fully with all federal, State and local laws and regulations which prohibit \ndiscrimination. The CONSULTANT’s signature affixed herein, and dated, shall constitute a certification \nunder penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the CONSULTANT has, unless \nexempt, complied with, the nondiscrimination program requirements of Government Code Section 12990 and \nTitle 2, California Administrative Code, Section 8103.\n\nPage 6 \nIn the event of CONSULTANT’S non-compliance with the non-discrimination clauses of this Agreement or \nwith any of the said rules, regulations or orders the COMMISSION may cancel, terminate or suspend the \nAgreement in whole or in part. CONSULTANT may also be declared ineligible for further agreements with \nthe COMMISSION. \n \n9. HARASSMENT. The COMMISSION maintains a strict policy prohibiting unlawful harassment, including \nsexual harassment, in any form, including verbal, physical and visual harassment by any employee, \nsupervisor, manager, officer or Board member, or agent of the employer. Vendors, CONSULTANTs, and \nconsultants shall not engage in conduct that has an effect of unreasonably interfering with a COMMISSION \nemployee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. \n \n10. LICENSES. If a license of any kind is required of CONSULTANT, its employees, agents, or sub \nCONSULTANTs by Federal or State law, CONSULTANT warrants that such license has been obtained, is \nvalid and in good standing, that CONSULTANT shall keep it in effect at all times during the terms of this \nAgreement, and that any applicable bond has been posted in accordance with all applicable laws and \nregulations. \n \n11. INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS. CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and \nconsidered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent \nCONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance \n(workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes. CONSULTANT is not entitled to \nany employee benefits. COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the \nmanner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein. \n \n \nPRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and \nmeans of accomplishing the result contracted for. \n \nSECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise \nover the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct \noccupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a \nspecialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the \nparticular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION \nsupplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is \nengaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the \njob rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather \nthan part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are \ncreating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) \nThe COMMISSION conducts public business. \n \nIt is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent \nCONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate \nthat CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT. \n \nBy their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered \njudgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT. \n \n12. RETENTION AND AUDIT OF RECORDS. For the purpose of determining compliance with Public \nContract Code 10115, et seq. and Title 21, California Code of Regulations, Chapter 21, Section 2500 et seq., \nif applicable and other matters connected with the performance of the contract pursuant to Government Code \n8546.7: CONSULTANT, subconsultants, and the COMMISSION shall maintain all books, documents, \npapers, accounting records, and other evidence pertaining to the performance of the contract, including but\n\nPage 7 \nnot limited to, the costs of administering the Agreement. All parties shall make such materials available at \ntheir respective offices at all reasonable times during the Agreement period and for five (5) years from the \ndate of final payment under this Agreement or until a final audit report is accepted by COMMISSION, \nwhichever occurs first. The COMMISSION and any state or federal auditor, or any duly authorized \nrepresentative of the state or federal government shall have access to any books, records, and documents of \nthe CONSULTANT that are pertinent to the Agreement for audit, examinations, excerpts, and transactions, \nand copies thereof shall be furnished if requested. \n \nSubcontracts in excess of $25,000 shall contain this provision.",
